## 📚 Template Library Strategy (Pro Tip)

Create multiple master templates for different scenarios:

```
Templates/
├── Dark-Melodic-Master.als          (Main template)
├── Dark-Melodic-Minimal.als         (Stripped down version)
├── Dark-Melodic-Aggressive.als      (Harder, faster style)
├── Dark-Melodic-Ambient.als         (More atmospheric)
└── Dark-Melodic-Experimental.als    (Weird sounds/effects)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero setup time
- ✅ Consistent workflow
- ✅ Genre-specific templates
- ✅ Professional approach
- ✅ Faster production
