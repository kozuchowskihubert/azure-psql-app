# TECH INTERVIEW TASK:

# Extract every third element from the list, starting from index 1.
# Decode each extracted number by applying the following rule using list comprehension:
#  - If the number is even, subtract 1.
#  - If the number is odd, add 1.

# Return the decoded numbers as a list of characters (assume each number represents an ASCII code).
# implement in this function.
